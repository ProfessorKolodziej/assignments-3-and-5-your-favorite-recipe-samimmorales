				<p>Did you know you can make homemade pasta without a pasta maker? Our step-by-step recipe will show you
					exactly
					how.
					<br>
					<br>

					I’ve been making pasta from scratch for about eight years now, often with a child standing at each hip,
					and all without using a pasta maker.
					<br>
					<br>

					Sometimes gadgets can be barriers to experimentation in the kitchen. But a small kitchen or a lack of
					funding shouldn’t prevent anyone from making delicious homemade food. I find that most meals can be made
					with
					just a few simple tools that serve multiple purposes.
					<br>
					<br>

					In the case of my homemade pasta, my rolling pin doubles as my pasta roller.

					<br>
					<br>

			<div class="container-two-p">

				<p>Making pasta by hand, you use a rolling pin to mimic the action of a pasta maker: roll out a small piece
					of
					dough until it’s paper thin. Then, use a knife to cut it into individual noodles.

					<br>
					<br>

					It takes a little more muscle and patience, but you can absolutely get the pasta as thin as you would
					using
					a
					machine.

			<div class="container-three-p">
				<p>Making pasta from scratch does take some time, but don’t let this dissuade you from making pasta at home.
					The
					dough can be made one day, and either refrigerated overnight or frozen so you can cut and shape your
					pasta on
					another day.</p>

				<br>
				<br>

				<p>Don’t refrigerate pasta dough for more than a day, however. Otherwise, the dough will discolor. If you
					don’t
					plan to make your pasta the next day, then freeze it.</p>

				<br>
				<br>

				<ul>
					<li>
						To freeze a ball of pasta dough, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap. Then, set it inside a zip-top bag
						with the
						air squeezed out of it (no need for oil). The morning you plan to make the pasta, just transfer it
						from the
						freezer to your countertop. It will be ready for you to roll out and cut later that afternoon.</li>

					<li>You can also freeze the cut noodles. Whenever I make homemade pasta, I always make a big batch and
						freeze
						the extra noodles for those moments when life demands more carbohydrates. Even straight from the
						freezer,
						homemade noodles cook faster than dried pasta from the store, so this makes for quick weeknight meals.

		<h2>Tips for Making Homemade Pasta</h2>
		<div class="container-four">
			<div class="container-four-p">
				<ul>
					<li>If the eggs break through your flour while mixing, don’t panic. Simply push some additional flour up
						against the break-through with your hand, and continue mixing. A bench scraper is also really useful
						here
						because it allows you to scoop up a lot of mess quickly. If you have one, keep it handy.</li>
					<br>

					<li>It’s important to rest the dough before rolling it out: This gives the gluten in the dough a chance
						to
						relax, which makes it easier to roll out. It makes a big difference when rolling out pasta by hand,
						verses
						using a machine.</li>
					<br>

					<li>If your pasta is sticky at any point, add more flour, a teaspoon at a time. When you roll it out,
						make sure
						you dust your countertop with flour at regular intervals. It’s also important to thoroughly dust the
						rolled-out pasta with flour before folding or rolling dough to cut into your desired shape.
					</li>

					<br>

					<div class="image-five">
						<img src="images/pasta_five.jpg" />
					</div>

					<li>If the dough starts to “snap back” as you roll it out: Pause and let it rest for 5 to 10 minutes (to
						give
						the gluten a chance to relax). Then, try rolling it again.</li>

					<br>

					<li>Cooking frozen noodles: Use frozen noodles straight from the freezer without thawing. Don’t leave
						them to
						thaw on the counter while you are preparing the rest of your meal. Sometimes, condensation or ice
						crystals
						form inside the bag. That will dampen your noodles and cause them to stick together as they thaw.</li>

				</ul>

			<p><strong>Extra Quick Pasta</strong>: If you’re pressed for time, roll out the pasta as described in Step 4.
				Then, use a pizza cutter to cut into strips. You can cut lengthwise or across, or even on the diagonal,
				whichever you prefer. This makes a more rustic pasta dish – but just as delicious.

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>

		<div>
			<ol>
				<li class="ingredientslist">2 3/4 cups (350g) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting and rolling</li>
				<li class="ingredientslist">4 large eggs</li>
				<li class="ingredientslist">1 egg yolk</li>

		<h2>Method</h2>

		<div class="container-stepone">
			<div class="container-stepone-p">

				<ol>
					<li>Mix the dough:

						<br>
						<br>

						<p>Heap the flour into a pile on the countertop. Create a large well or crater in the center, big
							enough
							to
							hold the eggs and olive oil like a bowl. Place the eggs, yolk, olive oil and salt into the well.
							Use a
							fork
							to whisk together the eggs and oil.
							<br>
							<br>
							Continue whisking the eggs, but begin pulling in bits of flour from inside the well. Use a stirring
							motion
							and go slowly to avoid any eggs breaking through the bowl of flour. (If the eggs break through your
							flour
							while mixing, don’t panic. Simply push some additional flour up against the break-through with your
							hand
							or
							with a bench scraper, and continue mixing).

							<br>
							<br>
							Continue like this until the dough starts to come together and the eggs have been incorporated. The
							dough
							will be damp and chunky in some parts and loose in others. And the mixture will still be quite
							floury.
							That’s ok. Use your hands or a bench scraper to continue bringing the dough together. I scoop the
							damp
							and
							crumbled dough up with my bench scraper and cut it into the rest of the dough.

				<ol>
					<li>Knead the dough:
						<br>
						<br>

						<p>When the dough looks relatively cohesive but still a bit scraggly, form it into a ball, and knead
							for 10
							minutes against the counter. The dough will be rough at first, but it should begin to tighten up
							and
							smooth out as you continue kneading.

							<br>
							<br>

							If the dough sticks to your hands, dust the countertop with a little more flour. If the dough is
							too
							stiff, add a teaspoon of water. Add more water or flour, a teaspoon at a time, until you get the
							right
							texture.
							<br>
							<br>
							In the end, you should have a soft, elastic dough that isn't sticky, and feels smooth like a baby’s
							bottom.

					<br>

					<p>When the dough has finished resting, shape it into a fat log and cut it into 5 or 6 equal sections.
						Leave
						one section out and re-wrap the others. (If you are working on a small counter, you can cut each piece
						in
						half again, so you are working with less dough.)

						<br>
						<br>

						Flour your workspace well, and use your rolling pin to roll out the dough into a long strip. With each
						pass as you roll, lift the dough up, re-dust the counter beneath, and flip it over. When you’re
						finished,
						you should have a long, thin piece of dough. It should be just about paper thin, but strong enough to
						be
						lifted off of the countertop.
